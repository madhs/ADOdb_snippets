Thank you for downloading this snippet package. I've added this note to those who newly install the snippet.

If you weren't aware of this, you can leverage on the selection feature which Sublime Editor provides for snippets.


**Selection Feature**
Some snippets allow you to embed selected text into the snippet.

**Snippet selection usage**

Step 1: In you PHP file, select and highlight the text you would like to be in a snippet. For example, `select * from employees`
Step 2: Press the sublime shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + P` to bring up the Command Palette
Step 3: Type `adodb_get` and choose the [adodb_get] snippet
Step 4: You will see that the SQL is inside the GetOne() method. You can press `Tab` to go through the fields in the snippet.

Some ADOdb database object methods which have similar names are under one common snippet. The list below describes the variations that a snippet could have
